## What to do next time you work on this

- [ ] Use the state context to store data (tags, brands, models), instead of always updating/refreshing the page

- [ ] When deleting tags/brands/models/collections, need to think of what to do for the ones linked to products

- [ ]  Need to add indexes, see how webdevcody saas does it, perhaps there is a pattern

- [ ] Upgrade to Tailwind 4, make a backup first before following the changes by tailwind and shadcn

## Stuff to implement later on the Storefront

- [ ] PostHog, for analytics
